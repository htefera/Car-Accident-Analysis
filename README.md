## Car Accident Analysis in the UK
## Obective 
The goal of the project is to analyze accident hotspots, identify factors that lead to accident causes, and develop a predictive model to identify fatal accidents. Given a dataset containing near half a million records of accidents that occurred between 2012 and 2014 in the UK, the goal was to obtain insights regarding three areas:
 
1. Identify the areas in which a large number of accidents occur
2. Discover the causes related to fatal accidents
3. Obtain a model capable of predicting whether a set of conditions would lead to an accident


## Tools

Python, Google Colab, and Google Maps services

## Data 
UK government amassed traffic data from 2012 and 2014
